		<p style="color: darkblue">Hi, welcome to my website, my name is Brayden Sterling. I'm a 15 yo graphic designer and also a web designer as well. I'll tell you about myself here like some of my favorite things, and more stuff about me! So feel free to explore! I hope this site gives you a good look at my work and what I enjoy creating.</p>
		<p style="color: darkblue">For my home page, I started by building the basic HTML skeleton with a header, navigation bar, main content area, and footer. I added a hero section at the top with a large title, a short introduction paragraph, and an image floated to the left. I used embedded CSS in the style section of the head to control the fonts, background colors, and layout.
I created a navigation bar with links to my other pages (Home, About Me, Favorite Things, and Contact). I also styled the links with hover effects so they change color when you move the mouse over them. For the layout, I demonstrated margin vs. padding by spacing and sizing the boxes and text.
Near the bottom of the page, I added three columns (“About Me,” “Favorite Things,” and “Contact Me”), each styled with color, padding, borders, and hover effects that make them lift slightly with a box shadow. Finally, I used an image with alt text for accessibility, and I set up media queries so the design is responsive and adjusts on smaller screens.</p>
