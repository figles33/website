            <p>Hi! I'm Brayden Sterling, a 15-year-old graphic and web designer passionate about creating beautiful and functional designs. I enjoy experimenting with new styles, learning the latest web technologies, and bringing creative ideas to life. Whether I'm working on digital art or coding a new website, I love sharing my creations with others. Thanks for stopping by to learn more about me!</p>
            <p>I'm pretty athletic, and I like sports, mainly soccer, track and field, and maybe some tennis. Working on graphics is pretty fun and I enjoy working on websites a lot, and also making logos like I did in the past. But overall I like the class, and think coding and designing is fun.</p>
